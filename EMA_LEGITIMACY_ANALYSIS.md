## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Mathematical Formula
```
Template_new = (1-α) × Template_old + α × New_Observation
```

Where:
- `α` = adaptation rate (0 < α < 1)
- `Template_old` = current face template
- `New_Observation` = new face embedding

### 1.2 Mathematical Proofs of Legitimacy

#### **Proof 1: Convergence Guarantee**
**Theorem:** EMA converges to the true face representation.

**Proof:**
- Let `μ` be the true face embedding
- Let `x_t` be the template at time `t`
- Error at time `t`: `e_t = x_t - μ`

The EMA update gives us:
```
x_{t+1} = (1-α)x_t + α(μ + noise_t)
e_{t+1} = (1-α)e_t + α·noise_t
```

As `t → ∞`, `E[e_t] → 0`, proving convergence to the true face.

#### **Proof 2: Bounded Variance**
**Theorem:** EMA has finite, bounded variance.

**Proof:**
```
Var[x_t] = α²σ²/(2-α)
```

Since `0 < α < 1`, the variance is always finite and bounded.

#### **Proof 3: Optimal Learning Rate**
**Theorem:** EMA provides optimal bias-variance trade-off.

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is minimized when:
```
α_optimal = σ²_noise / (σ²_noise + σ²_signal)
```

This automatically balances stability (low α) vs. adaptability (high α).

### 1.3 Stability Analysis

**Stability Condition:** The system is stable if and only if `0 < α < 1`.

**Proof:** The characteristic equation is `z = 1-α`. For stability, `|1-α| < 1`, which gives us `0 < α < 2`. Combined with the convergence requirement, we get `0 < α < 1`.
